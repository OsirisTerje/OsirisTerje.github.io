This section contains issues and resolutions (when available) for Visual Studio and TFS/VSTS.

It is focused on what I have been hit with myself, and is not a duplicate of the common lists available elsewhere.Â  I describe those that I don't easily find other places, so expect the more rare cases described.

Some of these issues arise from the use of preview releases that is later updated to release versions of the products.
